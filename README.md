# HelloWorldNet



HelloWorldnet is a modified version of [Exonet](https://gitlab.com/frontierdevelopmentlab/exoplanets/exonet-pytorch), which is in turn a modified version of [Astronet](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/astronet)

This work is a direct result of the [2019 PyTorch Summer Hackathon](https://info.devpost.com/pytorchmpkrules), hosted at Facebook HQ, with team members:

- [Gully](https://github.com/gully)
- [Grant](https://github.com/GrantRVD)
- [Humayun](https://github.com/humayun)


Our goal is to explore the accuracy and extensibility of Exonet to improve the discovery of extra-solar planets.


#### Original README for [ExonetNet-PyTorch](https://gitlab.com/frontierdevelopmentlab/exoplanets/exonet-pytorch):

> Exonet is a modified version of [Astronet](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/astronet), with added scientific "domain knowledge" and translated from TensorFlow to PyTorch.
This work is a direct result of the 2018, [NASA's Frontier Development Lab](https://frontierdevelopmentlab.org/) (FDL)

> ÃŸThere will soon also be a code for downloading the required *Kepler* light curves and generating the input views and labels.
For now, you can download the required input files from [this DropBox link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/sxj7r30thd66nij/AACptMysLyaMhXe817e4z7Sya?dl=0)
(you must divide them into train, val, and test folders for the code to work).
