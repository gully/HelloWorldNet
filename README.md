# HelloWorldNet



HelloWorldnet is a modified version of [Exonet](https://gitlab.com/frontierdevelopmentlab/exoplanets/exonet-pytorch), which is in turn a modified version of [Astronet](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/astronet)

This work is a direct result of the [2019 PyTorch Summer Hackathon](https://info.devpost.com/pytorchmpkrules), hosted at Facebook HQ, with team members:

- [Gully](https://github.com/gully)
- [Grant](https://github.com/GrantRVD) ([twitter](https://twitter.com/usethespacebar))
- [Humayun](https://github.com/humayun)


Our goal is to apply PyTorch to improve the speed and reliability of detecting exoplanets in [lightcurve](https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/features/yba/M31_velocity/lightcurve/lightcurve_more.html) data. Specifically, we're attempting to

- extend Exonet and Astronet for better precision and recall
- creating dataloaders for various data sources, such as Kepler, TESS, and K2
- exploring model architectures to improve transfer learning between exoplanet monitoring and detection tasks

> ÃŸThere will soon also be a code for downloading the required *Kepler* light curves and generating the input views and labels.
For now, you can download the required input files from [this DropBox link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/sxj7r30thd66nij/AACptMysLyaMhXe817e4z7Sya?dl=0)
(you must divide them into train, val, and test folders for the code to work).
